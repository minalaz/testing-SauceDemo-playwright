# Playwright Test Framework for E-commerce Website: [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

This repository contains an automated test suite for an e-commerce web application using the Playwright testing framework. It demonstrates the use of modern end-to-end testing techniques with a focus on maintainability and ease of use.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules for constants, locators, and page objects.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Enhances test maintenance and readability.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Uses `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: External JSON files for test data management.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Includes tests for various user interactions and scenarios.
- **Error Handling and Assertions**: Robust error handling and assertions for reliability.
